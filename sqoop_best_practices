Best practices for Sqoop
===============================
Use standard connector for connecting with different source systems
Avoid direct data ingestion into production table;Follow staging location/Intermediate location to import the data into production table
Determine boundary values for sqoop import, the lower bound and upper bound values, supply these values for better performance
Supply necessary output formatting  options such as --fields-terminated-by, --enclosed-by,--escaped_by
Set appropriate degree of parallelism suing -m option, for small table -m 1 is ideal fit.
When sqooping data into hive tables use dynamic partitions
Make script resuable by using an options file option
Make debugging simpilar by using --verbose command in the script
Know the limitaion of Sqoop
     - BLOB, CLOB data import
Handle data type conversion issue by Changing the data type mapping in sqoop.
    --map-column-java <mapping> Override mapping from SQL to Java type for configured columns.
    --map-column-hive <mapping> Override mapping from SQL to Hive type for configured columns.

It is suggested not to use a greater value that 4 as this might occupy the entire spool space of the database

Handle null values 

Latest stable release is 1.4. 7
